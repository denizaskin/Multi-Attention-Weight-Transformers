# How to Use This PR - Direct Code Changes Workflow

## 🎯 What Changed

Previously, the AI would just **print suggested changes** in the conversation. Now, the AI **makes direct changes to your codebase** that you can review and accept through GitHub's PR interface!

## ✅ What This PR Contains

This PR implements the 64 depth dimension architecture you requested with:

1. **Direct code changes** to `maw_vs_non_maw.py` (639 lines)
2. **Updated dependencies** in `requirements.txt`
3. **Documentation** of all changes:
   - `CHANGES_SUMMARY.md` - Detailed what changed
   - `ARCHITECTURE_COMPARISON.md` - Visual before/after
   - `HOW_TO_USE_THIS_PR.md` - This file

## 📋 How to Review & Accept Changes

## 🚀 Testing the Changes

### Quick Test (Synthetic Data)
```bash
# No installation needed - uses synthetic data
python maw_vs_non_maw.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
⚠️  Real dataset libraries not available. Using synthetic data.
🚀 NON-MAW vs MAW+GRPO (64 Depth Dimensions)
======================================================================
📋 Configuration:
   Hidden dim: 512 (was 256)
   Num heads: 8
   Head dim (DEPTH): 64 (was 32)
   Depth formula: 512 / 8 = 64
   5D attention: (batch, 8, seq, seq, 64)
...
🔥 Training GRPO Router (64 depth patterns) for 10 epochs...
Epoch 1/10: Loss = 0.xxxxx, Patterns used: 12/64, Most common: 23
...
```

### Full Test (Real Datasets)
```bash
# Install required libraries
pip install torch transformers ir-datasets ir_measures

# Run with real data
python maw_vs_non_maw.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🚀 NON-MAW vs MAW+GRPO (64 Depth Dimensions)
📥 Loading TREC-DL 2019 dataset...
✅ Loaded 30 queries, 5000 documents
🔄 Encoding real texts to embeddings...
✅ Using real Tier-1 datasets
...
📊 Results for MAW+GRPO (64-depth):
   Patterns used: 15/64 (23.4%)
```

## 📝 What Changed Summary

### Configuration
- ✅ Hidden dimensions: 256 → **512**
- ✅ Depth dimensions: 8 → **64**
- ✅ Sequence length: 64 → **128**
- ✅ Vocab size: 1000 → **30,522** (BERT)

### Architecture
- ✅ 5D attention: `(batch, 8, seq, seq, 64)`
- ✅ GRPO router: 8 patterns → **64 patterns**
- ✅ Enhanced router: 2 layers → **3 layers** with layer norm
- ✅ Pattern tracking: Shows which of 64 patterns are used

### Datasets
- ✅ Real dataset support: TREC-DL 2019, MS MARCO
- ✅ BERT integration: Text encoding with frozen weights
- ✅ Automatic fallback: Uses synthetic if libraries unavailable

## 🔍 Review Checklist

Before merging, verify:
- [ ] Config now uses 512 hidden_dim and 64 depth_dim
- [ ] 5D attention shape is `(batch, 8, seq, seq, 64)`
- [ ] Code runs without errors (test with `python maw_vs_non_maw.py`)
- [ ] Pattern tracking shows "X/64" in training/eval output
- [ ] Requirements.txt includes transformers, ir-datasets, ir_measures
- [ ] Documentation files explain the changes clearly

## 💡 Key Points

### This is NOT just suggestions!
- ❌ **Before**: AI printed code suggestions, you had to copy/paste manually
- ✅ **After**: AI makes direct changes, you just review and merge

### The "keep" option you mentioned
When you merge this PR, you're essentially accepting the changes. GitHub's PR interface lets you:
- ✅ **Accept** (merge) - Keep all changes
- ✅ **Comment** - Request modifications
- ✅ **Reject** - Close the PR without merging

### Making Additional Changes
