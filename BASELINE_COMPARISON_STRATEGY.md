## 📊 Recommended Comparison Strategy for Tier-1 Journals

### ✅ **Primary Recommendation: Multi-Baseline Comparison**

For a strong Tier-1 journal submission (SIGIR, WWW, EMNLP, ACL, NeurIPS), you should include **multiple baselines** at different levels of complexity:

---

## 🏆 Tier 1: Essential Baselines (MUST HAVE)

### 1. **Static Attention (Non-MAW) - Current ✅**
```python
# What you already have
Traditional transformer with single attention weight per query-key pair
No depth selection mechanism
```

**Why Essential:**
- Shows the benefit of multi-attention-weight concept
- Minimal baseline - same architecture without MAW
- **Already implemented** ✅

**Justification for Paper:**
- "Ablation study: MAW vs. standard attention"
- Shows the core contribution

---

### 2. **Random Depth Selection**
```python
# NEW BASELINE TO ADD
class RandomDepthSelector:
    def forward(self, attention_5d):
        # Randomly select depth instead of learning
        random_depth = torch.randint(0, depth_dim, (batch_size,))
        return select_depth(attention_5d, random_depth)
```

**Why Essential:**
- Shows that learned selection > random selection
- Controls for "maybe any depth selection helps"
- **Easy to implement** (~30 lines)

**Justification for Paper:**
- "Shows learning is necessary, not just selection"
- Stronger ablation

---

### 3. **Fixed/Heuristic Depth Selection**
```python
# NEW BASELINE TO ADD
class HeuristicDepthSelector:
    def forward(self, attention_5d):
        # Always pick middle depth or based on simple rule
        fixed_depth = depth_dim // 2  # Always use middle
        return fixed_depth
```

**Why Essential:**
- Shows adaptive selection > fixed strategy
- Common in neural architecture search literature
- **Very easy to implement** (~20 lines)

**Justification for Paper:**
- "Demonstrates need for query-specific selection"

---

## 🥈 Tier 2: Strong Competitive Baselines (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)

### 4. **Fine-tuned Query/Key Projections**
```python
# NEW BASELINE TO ADD - More parameters but no depth selection
class FineTunedProjections:
    def __init__(self):
        # Add learnable query/key transformations
        self.query_transform = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.key_transform = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, hidden_dim)
    
    def forward(self, Q, K, V):
        Q_ft = self.query_transform(Q)
        K_ft = self.key_transform(K)
        return standard_attention(Q_ft, K_ft, V)
```

**Why Recommended:**
- Same parameter budget as MAW router
- Shows MAW concept > just adding parameters
- Common baseline in attention papers
- **Moderate difficulty** (~50 lines)

**Justification for Paper:**
- "Controls for parameter count"
- "Shows architectural innovation matters"

---

### 5. **Multi-Head Attention with More Heads**
```python
# NEW BASELINE TO ADD
# Instead of 8 heads + depth selection, use 32 heads (no depth)
standard_transformer_32_heads = Transformer(num_heads=32, no_depth=True)
```

**Why Recommended:**
- Same computation budget
- Shows depth diversity > head diversity alone
- Standard approach in literature
- **Easy to implement** (just change num_heads)

**Justification for Paper:**
- "MAW offers different kind of diversity than more heads"
- Addresses obvious alternative

---

## 🥉 Tier 3: Advanced Baselines (GOOD TO HAVE)

### 6. **Neural Architecture Search (NAS) Baseline**
```python
# Sample different architectures for each query
class NASBaseline:
    def forward(self, query):
        # Use learned policy to select entire architecture
        # Similar to MAW but selects full attention mechanism
```

**Why Good:**
- Shows MAW is efficient vs. full NAS
- Connects to broader NAS literature
- **High difficulty** (complex implementation)

**Justification for Paper:**
- "MAW more efficient than full architecture search"

---

### 7. **Mixture of Experts (MoE) Attention**
```python
# Multiple attention mechanisms, gate selects mixture
class MoEAttention:
    def forward(self, Q, K, V):
        # Compute multiple attention patterns
        # Gate network combines them
        attentions = [expert(Q, K, V) for expert in self.experts]
        weights = self.gate(Q)
        return weighted_sum(attentions, weights)
```

**Why Good:**
- Related architecture from MoE literature
- Shows hard selection (MAW) vs. soft mixing
- **High difficulty** (complex)

**Justification for Paper:**
- "MAW uses hard selection, potentially more interpretable"

---

## ❌ NOT RECOMMENDED: Full Embedder Fine-tuning

### Why NOT Full Embedder Fine-tuning as Main Baseline?

**Problem 1: Different Learning Paradigm**
```
MAW: Learn depth selection policy (lightweight)
Full Fine-tuning: Learn all embeddings (heavyweight)
```
- Not a fair comparison
- Different objectives
- Different data requirements

**Problem 2: Orthogonal Approaches**
- MAW can be COMBINED with fine-tuning
- They're complementary, not competing

**Problem 3: Reviewer Criticism**
- "You're comparing architecture innovation vs. optimization"
- "Why not do both?"
- "Not addressing the same research question"

**Problem 4: Data Requirements**
- Full fine-tuning needs massive data
- MAW works with limited data
- Unfair advantage to one or the other

Would you like me to implement any of these baselines? The Random/Fixed depth selection ones are very quick (~1-2 hours total).
