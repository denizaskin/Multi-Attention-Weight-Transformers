# Tier-1 Journal Metrics and K-Values - Standard Reporting

## üéØ Your Question
> What other metrics and K-values are customary to report in Tier-1 journals?

---

## üìä Current Implementation

**Metrics:** Hit Rate, MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank), NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)
**K-values:** [1, 5, 10, 100, 1000]

---

## ‚úÖ Standard Metrics in Tier-1 IR Journals/Conferences

### 1. **Core Metrics** (Your current ones are EXCELLENT! ‚úÖ)

#### Hit Rate (Recall) @ K
- **What:** Did the relevant document appear in top-K?
- **Used in:** SIGIR, WWW, WSDM, RecSys
- **Typical K:** 1, 5, 10, 20, 100
- ‚úÖ **You have this**

#### MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank) @ K  
- **What:** 1 / rank of first relevant document
- **Used in:** SIGIR, EMNLP, ACL, MS MARCO leaderboard
- **Typical K:** 10, 100
- ‚úÖ **You have this**

#### NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) @ K
- **What:** Position-sensitive relevance measure
- **Used in:** SIGIR, WWW, WSDM, CIKM (MOST IMPORTANT)
- **Typical K:** 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 100
- ‚úÖ **You have this**

---

### 2. **Common Additional Metrics** (Consider Adding)

#### Precision @ K ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED
```python
def precision_at_k(relevance_scores, sorted_indices, k):
    """
    Precision@K: Fraction of top-K that are relevant
    """
    top_k_relevance = [relevance_scores[i] for i in sorted_indices[:k]]
    relevant_count = sum(1 for rel in top_k_relevance if rel > 0)
    return relevant_count / k
```

**Why add:**
- Standard in SIGIR, TREC papers
- Easy to understand
- Complements Recall (Hit Rate)

**Typical K:** 1, 5, 10, 20

---

#### MAP (Mean Average Precision) ‚≠ê‚≠ê HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
```python
def average_precision(relevance_scores, sorted_indices):
    """
    AP: Average of precision values at positions where relevant docs occur
    """
    precisions = []
    relevant_count = 0
    
    for i, idx in enumerate(sorted_indices, 1):
        if relevance_scores[idx] > 0:
            relevant_count += 1
            precisions.append(relevant_count / i)
    
    if not precisions:
        return 0.0
    return sum(precisions) / len(precisions)
```

**Why add:**
- Gold standard in IR research
- Used in TREC, SIGIR, CIKM
- Considers all relevant documents
- Single-value metric (no K needed!)

**No K needed** - considers full ranking

---

#### Recall @ K (More explicit than Hit Rate)
```python
def recall_at_k(relevance_scores, sorted_indices, k):
    """
    Recall@K: Fraction of relevant docs that appear in top-K
    """
    top_k_relevance = [relevance_scores[i] for i in sorted_indices[:k]]
    relevant_in_k = sum(1 for rel in top_k_relevance if rel > 0)
    total_relevant = sum(1 for rel in relevance_scores if rel > 0)
    
    if total_relevant == 0:
        return 0.0
    return relevant_in_k / total_relevant
```

**Why add:**
- More explicit than Hit Rate
- Standard in recommendation papers (RecSys, WWW)

**Typical K:** 5, 10, 20, 50, 100

---

### 3. **Domain-Specific Metrics** (Optional)

#### ERR (Expected Reciprocal Rank) @ K
- **Used in:** Some SIGIR papers, web search evaluation
- **Benefit:** Models cascading user behavior
- **Complexity:** Higher - requires graded relevance

#### RBP (Rank-Biased Precision)
- **Used in:** Some SIGIR/CIKM papers
- **Benefit:** Models user persistence
- **Complexity:** Higher

#### Success @ K (for conversational search)
- **Used in:** EMNLP, ACL, conversational IR
- **When:** If you frame as dialogue/QA

```python
metrics = ['Hit Rate', 'MRR', 'NDCG']
k_values = [1, 5, 10, 100, 1000]
```
**Justification:** Covers early precision (1,5), standard (10), deep ranking (100, 1000)

```

**Additions:**

## üí° My Recommendation for Your Paper

### **Option A: Keep Current + Add MAP** (Easiest)
```python
metrics = ['Hit Rate', 'MRR', 'NDCG', 'MAP']
k_values = [1, 5, 10, 100, 1000]
```

**Effort:** ~1 hour to implement MAP
**Benefit:** MAP is widely expected in SIGIR/TREC papers
**Result:** Standard reporting ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

---

### **Option B: Standard Suite** (Recommended)
```python
metrics = ['Precision', 'Recall', 'MRR', 'NDCG', 'MAP']
k_values = [1, 5, 10, 20, 100, 1000]
```

**Changes:**
- Replace "Hit Rate" with "Recall" (more standard term)
- Add "Precision"
- Add "MAP"
- Add K=20 (common middle ground)

**Effort:** ~2 hours to implement all
**Benefit:** Comprehensive evaluation, addresses all review concerns
**Result:** Strong paper ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

---

### **Option C: Minimal Change**
Keep exactly what you have! It's already good for Tier-1:
```python
metrics = ['Hit Rate', 'MRR', 'NDCG']
k_values = [1, 5, 10, 100, 1000]
```

**Why acceptable:**
- NDCG is the gold standard (you have it)
- MRR is standard (you have it)
- K values cover early + deep (you have it)
- Hit Rate = Recall@K for binary relevance

**Result:** Acceptable ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

## üìö Citation Examples

When you write your paper:

```
"We evaluate using standard information retrieval metrics: 
Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG@K) [J√§rvelin & Kek√§l√§inen, 2002],
Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR@K) [Voorhees, 1999], 
and Mean Average Precision (MAP) [Buckley & Voorhees, 2000]."
```

---

## üéØ Final Recommendation

### For Tier-1 Journal Submission:

**Minimal Viable:**
- Keep what you have ‚úÖ
- Add MAP (~1 hour)

**Recommended:**
- Add MAP
- Add Precision@K
- Rename "Hit Rate" to "Recall"
- Add K=20
- Total: ~2-3 hours work

**Result:** Paper will have comprehensive evaluation meeting all reviewer expectations.

---

## üìä K-Value Justification for Paper

```
K=1:    Early precision - first result matters
K=5:    Short result list - user attention span
K=10:   Standard comparison point (MS MARCO, TREC)
K=20:   Extended result list - common in practice
K=100:  Deep ranking - comprehensive recall
K=1000: Maximum depth - ultimate recall
```

This justification addresses potential reviewer question: "Why these K values?"

Would you like me to implement MAP, Precision, and Recall metrics? Takes ~2 hours and would strengthen your paper significantly for Tier-1 submission! üöÄ
